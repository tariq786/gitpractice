Life is but thought so think i will
that i and youth are housemates still

Treacherous in calm and deceptive in storm
who shall put forth on thee
the unfathomable see

Simplicity favors regularity

#Following Modification is in experiment branch
I dont know
Knowledge is power

#back to the original branch
Playing hangman here and there
Putting thoughts in order
Putting words in sentences
